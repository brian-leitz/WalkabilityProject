## WalkabilityProject

## Introduction:
Detroit's walkability project presented on this GitHub page aims to analyze and visualize walkability in the city and provide recommendations for improving pedestrian infrastructure. To achieve this goal, the project uses a variety of tools, including Python, Pandas, ArcGIS, HTML, CSS, and JS to clean, process, analyze, and visualize data related to walkability in Detroit. The original dataset used in the project was obtained from the website https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index. By leveraging these tools, the project can provide valuable insights into pedestrian infrastructure and potential areas for improvement, which can help make Detroit a safer, more attractive, and more accessible city for all residents and visitors. With its rich history as a hub for music and culture, improving walkability in Detroit can help to address challenges such as urban decay and crime and create a more sustainable and livable city for years to come.

## Summary

Detroit is walkable in certain areas, but disconnects and becomes less walkable sporadically throughout the city, there are also a lack of things to do in general including outside attractions that increase walkability like parks and such.
Our goal is to provide guidance and insights to potential investors and business owners on where to focus their efforts and resources in Detroit, but also to connect the city, and to make Detroit and the downtown area a destination for things to do, an attractive location to hold events like the Final Four, Bowl Games, Concerts, Music Festivals, Super Bowl, and other attractions that will bring a massive amount of new revenue to the city and help create a bustling tourist hub in Detroit. If Detroit can achieve these goals, increased spending by large events, entertainment areas, higher potential population and will generate higher tax revenues which can then be reinvested into the city for future endeavors.
We want and feel that the city needs to be more walkable in order to bring more people in and transform Detroit into a more attractive destination for tourists, events, and also young professionals looking to build a life in a big city. Lower density between attractions and destinations within the city will make it more walkable, create more things for locals and tourists to enjoy the city of Detroit by foot or bike. Pedestrian-friendly areas also tend to attract a variety of businesses, including small shops and restaurants, which can help to revitalize local economies.

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate an argument and analysis on how to and what will make the city more walkable
- Show visualization arguments, provide arguments as to why walkability is high in comparable cities and their success stories or reasons in terms of being an attractive destination, provide correlation comparisons?
- Make the city more walkable based on our analysis, insights, and comparable successes (comparable cities) displayed
